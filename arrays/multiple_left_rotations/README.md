Given an array of integers A and multiple values in B, which represents the number of times array A needs to be left rotated.

Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the from of a matrix where ith row represents the rotated array for the ith value in B.  

Input 1:
 
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    B = [2, 3]

Output 1:
 
    [ [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
     [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] ]  


Input 2:

  
    A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
    B = [1]  


Output 2:

    
    [ [17, 100, 11, 5] ]
