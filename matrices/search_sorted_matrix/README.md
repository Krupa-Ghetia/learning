Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B.
In the given matrix every row and column is sorted in increasing order. Find and return the position of B in the matrix in the given form:
If A[i][j] = B then return (i * 1009 + j)
If B is not present return -1.

Note 1: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
Note 2: If there are multiple B in A then return the smallest value of i*1009 +j such that A[i][j]=B.  

Example:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    B = 2
Output:
    result = 1011
```
