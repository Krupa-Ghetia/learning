You are given two strings, A and B, of size N and M, respectively.

You have to find the count of all permutations of A present in B as a substring. You can assume a string will have only lowercase letters.  

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = "abc"
    B = "abcbacabc"
Output:
    count = 5
```

Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = "aca"
    B = "acaa"
Output:
    count = 2
```
