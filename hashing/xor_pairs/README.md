Given an integer array arr containing N distinct integers.

Find the number of unique pairs of integers in the array whose XOR is equal to k.

NOTE:

Pair (a, b) and (b, a) is considered to be the same and should be counted once.  

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [5, 4, 10, 15, 7, 6]
    k = 5
Output:
    count = 1
```

Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 15, 50]
    k = 5
Output:
    count = 2
```
