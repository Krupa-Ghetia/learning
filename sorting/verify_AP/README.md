Given an array, check if we can form an Arithmetic progression using the elements from the array.  

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [3,1,5]
Output:
    result = True
Explanation:
    Both [1,3,5] and [5,3,1] are an AP
```

Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [3,5,2,8]
Output:
    result = True
Explanation:
    Both [2,3,5,8] and [8,5,3,2] do not satisfy the conditions to form an AP.
```
