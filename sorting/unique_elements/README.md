You are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique. To do so, in one step you can increase any number by one.

Find the minimum number of steps.  

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = [1,1,3]
Output:
    step_count = 1
```
Explanation: We can increase the value of 1st element by 1 in 1 step and will get all unique elements. i.e [2, 1, 3].


Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = [2,4,5]
Output:
    step_count = 0
```
Explanation: All elements are distinct.
