Given an array A of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output:
    largestNum = '9534330'
```

Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    A = [2,3,9,0]
Output:
    largestNum = '9320'
```
