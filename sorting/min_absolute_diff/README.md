Given an array, find and return all pairs of numbers with absolute minimum difference in the array.  
There should be no duplicate pairs and the output should be sorted.  

Example 1:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [3,2,1,4,6]
Output:
    result = [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)]
```

Example 2:
```buildoutcfg
Input:
    arr = [2,3,4,6,3,3,1]
Output:
    result = [(3,3)
```
